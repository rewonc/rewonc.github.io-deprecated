Some time ago I came across the "Constellation" pieces by artist Kumi Yamashita. In case you haven't seen them, you can look at them at her [online gallery][http://www.kumiyamashita.com/constellation/]. The portraits are marvelous to look at and incredibly intricate. I think it's wonderful how a fluid, organic portrait can emerge from simple, rough components.

I will occasionally go back to view them and wonder just how much time she must have invested into creating each portrait. That naturally leads me to thinking about what I might do if I were to create something similar. It just so happened that over the past few weeks I have 1) been doing a fair amount of self study on graph transformation algorithms for a separate project and 2) have moved into a new loft apartment in Emeryville, CA with some seriously bare walls. So as a means of challenging my understanding of the material I was learning and also furnishing my apartment, I decided to recreate a Yamashita-style portrait on my own wall. I would choose a photo to erect, write a small script to tell me which lines to draw, then get some nails and some thread and put it up. 

As I was enlisting the help of a computer to do this all, moreover, I figured I'd add an extra challenge on top of it: make the portrait in color.  As images are often represented as maps of pixels with distinct values for their red, green, and blue intensity, I figured that with one red, one green, and one blue thread I ought to be able to find a way to render a convincing portrait on a bed of nails.
